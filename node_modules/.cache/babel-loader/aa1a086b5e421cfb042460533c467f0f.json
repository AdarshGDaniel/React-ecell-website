The students were divided into teams and each team got 15 minutes to pitch their best ideas in a creative way. There were three winners after this event. We were introduced to numerous ideas after the event and the winning idea turned out to be ‘Exoskeleton’. Nearly 20-30 Ideas were pitched by students.\"/>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            <Footer2 />\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default PastEventsPage;"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAOA,MAAP,EAAgBC,SAAhB,KAAiC,OAAjC,CACA,MAAO,sBAAP,CACA,MAAOC,QAAP,KAAoB,0BAApB,CACA,MAAOC,QAAP,KAAoB,mBAApB,CACA,MAAOC,SAAP,KAAqB,2BAArB,CACA,MAAOC,aAAP,KAAyB,+BAAzB,CACA,MAAOC,kBAAP,KAA8B,oCAA9B,CACA,MAAOC,kBAAP,KAA8B,oCAA9B,CACA,MAAOC,gBAAP,KAA4B,kCAA5B,CACA,MAAOC,YAAP,KAAwB,8BAAxB,CACA,MAAOC,UAAP,KAAsB,aAAtB,CACA,MAAOC,WAAP,KAAuB,cAAvB,CACA,OAASC,IAAT,CAAeC,aAAa,GAAIC,OAAhC,KAA8C,cAA9C,CACA,MAAOC,KAAP,KAAiB,gBAAjB,CACA,MAAOC,KAAP,KAAiB,gBAAjB,CACA,MAAOC,KAAP,KAAiB,gBAAjB,CACA,MAAOC,KAAP,KAAiB,gBAAjB,CACA,MAAOC,KAAP,KAAiB,gBAAjB,CACA,MAAOC,KAAP,KAAiB,gBAAjB,CACA,MAAOC,KAAP,KAAiB,iBAAjB,CACA,MAAOC,KAAP,KAAiB,gBAAjB,CACA,MAAOC,KAAP,KAAiB,gBAAjB,CACA,MAAOC,MAAP,KAAkB,iBAAlB,CACA,MAAOC,MAAP,KAAkB,iBAAlB,CACA,MAAOC,MAAP,KAAkB,iBAAlB,C,wFAGA,QAASC,eAAT,CAAwBC,KAAxB,CAA+B,CAE3B3B,SAAS,CAAC,UAAM,CACZ4B,MAAM,CAACC,QAAP,CAAgB,CAAhB,CAAmB,CAAnB,EACD,CAFM,CAEJ,EAFI,CAAT,CAIA,mBACI,oCACI,KAAC,OAAD,EAAS,IAAI,CAAC,MAAd,EADJ,cAEI,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAf,uBACY,MAAC,QAAD,yBACI,MAAC,YAAD,yBACI,MAAC,iBAAD,yBACA,KAAC,WAAD,IADA,cAEA,KAAC,iBAAD,IAFA,GADJ,cAKI,KAAC,eAAD,wBAAiB,KAAC,IAAD,EAAM,KAAK,CAAE,CAACC,MAAM,CAAE,SAAT,CAAb,CAAkC,WAAW,CAAC,QAA9C,CAAuD,EAAE,CAAC,MAA1D,CAAiE,GAAG,CAAE,IAAtE,CAA4E,MAAM,CAAE,IAApF,CAA0F,MAAM,CAAE,CAAC,EAAnG,CAAuG,QAAQ,CAAE,GAAjH,kBAAjB,EALJ,GADJ,cAQI,MAAC,YAAD,yBACI,MAAC,iBAAD,yBACA,KAAC,WAAD,IADA,cAEA,KAAC,iBAAD,IAFA,GADJ,cAKI,KAAC,eAAD,wBAAiB,KAAC,IAAD,EAAM,KAAK,CAAE,CAACA,MAAM,CAAE,SAAT,CAAb,CAAkC,WAAW,CAAC,QAA9C,CAAuD,EAAE,CAAC,MAA1D,CAAiE,GAAG,CAAE,IAAtE,CAA4E,MAAM,CAAE,IAApF,CAA0F,MAAM,CAAE,CAAC,EAAnG,CAAuG,QAAQ,CAAE,GAAjH,kBAAjB,EALJ,GARJ,cAeI,MAAC,YAAD,yBACI,KAAC,iBAAD,wBACA,KAAC,WAAD,IADA,EADJ,cAII,KAAC,eAAD,wBAAiB,KAAC,IAAD,EAAM,KAAK,CAAE,CAACA,MAAM,CAAE,SAAT,CAAb,CAAkC,WAAW,CAAC,QAA9C,CAAuD,EAAE,CAAC,MAA1D,CAAiE,GAAG,CAAE,IAAtE,CAA4E,MAAM,CAAE,IAApF,CAA0F,MAAM,CAAE,CAAC,EAAnG,CAAuG,QAAQ,CAAE,GAAjH,kBAAjB,EAJJ,GAfJ,GADZ,EAFJ,cA0BQ,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,uBAAf,uBACI,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAf,wBACI,aAAK,EAAE,CAAC,MAAR,CAAe,SAAS,CAAC,wBAAzB,wBACI,4BADJ,cAEI,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,UAAf,EAFJ,GADJ,cAKI,KAAC,SAAD,EAAW,KAAK,CAAEL,KAAlB,CAAyB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA9B,CAA4C,KAAK,CAAC,qBAAlD,CAAwE,WAAW,CAAC,kSAApF,EALJ,cAMI,KAAC,UAAD,EAAY,KAAK,CAAED,KAAnB,CAA0B,IAAI,CAAC,aAA/B,CAA6C,KAAK,CAAC,kDAAnD,CAAsG,WAAW,CAAC,oMAAlH,EANJ,cAOI,KAAC,SAAD,EAAW,KAAK,CAAED,KAAlB,CAAyB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA9B,CAA4C,KAAK,CAAC,cAAlD,CAAiE,WAAW,CAAC,6OAA7E,EAPJ,cAQI,KAAC,UAAD,EAAY,KAAK,CAAED,IAAnB,CAAyB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA9B,CAA4C,KAAK,CAAC,qBAAlD,CAAwE,WAAW,CAAC,qTAApF,EARJ,cASI,KAAC,SAAD,EAAW,KAAK,CAAED,IAAlB,CAAwB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA7B,CAA2C,KAAK,CAAC,qBAAjD,CAAuE,WAAW,CAAC,0QAAnF,EATJ,cAUI,aAAK,EAAE,CAAC,MAAR,CAAe,SAAS,CAAC,wBAAzB,wBACI,4BADJ,cAEI,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,UAAf,EAFJ,GAVJ,cAcI,KAAC,UAAD,EAAY,KAAK,CAAED,IAAnB,CAAyB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA9B,CAA4C,KAAK,CAAC,WAAlD,CAA8D,WAAW,CAAC,gYAA1E,EAdJ,cAeI,KAAC,SAAD,EAAW,KAAK,CAAED,IAAlB,CAAwB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA7B,CAA2C,KAAK,CAAC,8BAAjD,CAAgF,WAAW,CAAC,6LAA5F,EAfJ,cAgBI,KAAC,UAAD,EAAY,KAAK,CAAED,IAAnB,CAAyB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA9B,CAA4C,KAAK,CAAC,8BAAlD,CAAiF,WAAW,CAAC,mSAA7F,EAhBJ,cAiBI,KAAC,SAAD,EAAW,KAAK,CAAED,IAAlB,CAAwB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA7B,CAA2C,KAAK,CAAC,8BAAjD,CAAgF,WAAW,CAAC,6UAA5F,EAjBJ,cAkBI,KAAC,UAAD,EAAY,KAAK,CAAED,IAAnB,CAAyB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA9B,CAA4C,KAAK,CAAC,YAAlD,CAA+D,WAAW,CAAC,sRAA3E,EAlBJ,cAmBI,KAAC,SAAD,EAAW,KAAK,CAAED,IAAlB,CAAwB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA7B,CAA2C,KAAK,CAAC,2BAAjD,CAA6E,WAAW,CAAC,6gBAAzF,EAnBJ,cAoBI,aAAK,EAAE,CAAC,MAAR,CAAe,SAAS,CAAC,wBAAzB,wBACI,4BADJ,cAEI,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,UAAf,EAFJ,GApBJ,cAwBI,KAAC,UAAD,EAAY,KAAK,CAAED,IAAnB,CAAyB,IAAI,CAAC,aAA9B,CAA4C,KAAK,CAAC,YAAlD,CAA+D,WAAW,CAAC,mdAA3E,EAxBJ,GADJ,EA1BR,cAuDI,KAAC,OAAD,IAvDJ,GADJ,CA2DH,CAED,cAAeY,eAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
